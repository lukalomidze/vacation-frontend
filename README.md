# Vacation Control System

Vacation Control System app for a Software Engineering class

Features include:

1. Vacation request
2. Approving/rejecting vacations by administrator/supervisor
3. Register new employee as an administrator
4. Inspect employee data as an admin/supervisor

Utilizes Spring Security for authentication and Spring Data Jpa for database interactions

Example authentication data for testing:
1. Admin: admin@ribas.pt
2. Supervisor: ilamboll@ribas.pt
3. Employee: cpreon@ribas.pt

Password for every existing employee/administrator is `password`

For the sake of consistent starting point during testing, only an in-memory database is used

If testing locally, include `VITE_BACKEND_URL` in a `.env` file at the root directory
